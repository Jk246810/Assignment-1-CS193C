			My name is Jamee Krzanich. I am sixteen years old and an upcoming Junior in Highschool. I am currently attending Sacred Heart Preparatory. My Sophmore year I took AP Computer Science and fell in love with the class and concepts. As a result, I decided to take a few classes over the summer at <span class="stanfordStyle">Stanford</span> to see if computer science is a career that I could see myself doing as a career. So far, I am having a great time at <span class="stanfordStyle">Stanford</span> and am loving all of my classes.

I attended Montessori school as a young child and was able to foster my attention span and passion on a daily basis.  From learning the bones of the body to buildilng and re-building the trinomial cube, I've always been able to invest time and energy in anything that was interesting within a specific moment in time.  As a young reader, my passion became literature and I would read books by the series as fast as I could download them onto the kindle.  Towards the end of middle school I became interested in computer applications and enrolled in an 8 week, full day camp that included a comprehensive deliverable.  I enjoyed it so much that I re-enrolled the following summer and became an Apple Store approved developer and my song playlist sharing App was approved by Apple and available for download.

	Throughout our lives, we are exposed to a variety of experiences that either stimulate our senses or cause us to recoil.  I am exploring the option of studying Computer Science with the realization that there are a plethora of amazing academic opportunities to pursue.
